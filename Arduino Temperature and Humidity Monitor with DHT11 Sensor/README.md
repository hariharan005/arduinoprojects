***Arduino Temperature and Humidity Monitor with DHT11 Sensor***
Project Description:

This project involves creating a temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor. The DHT11 sensor is a low-cost device capable of providing accurate temperature and humidity readings. The Arduino, programmed with the appropriate code, reads data from the sensor and displays it on the Serial Monitor.
Key Features:

    Real-time Monitoring:
    The system continuously reads temperature and humidity values in real-time using the DHT11 sensor.

    Alert System:
    The Arduino is programmed to check if the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold (30Â°C in this case). If the temperature is high, an alert message is sent to the Serial Monitor.

    User Interface:
    The Serial Monitor serves as a simple user interface, displaying temperature, humidity, and alerts. Users can observe the environmental conditions and receive notifications if the temperature is above the specified limit.

    Hardware Setup:
    The DHT11 sensor is connected to the Arduino, and the code defines the pin configuration. The Arduino board powers the sensor and processes the data, making it accessible for monitoring.

Potential Enhancements:

    LCD Display: Add an LCD display to provide a standalone visual interface without relying on the Serial Monitor.
    Data Logging: Implement a data logging feature to record temperature and humidity values over time.
    Mobile App Integration: Extend the project by integrating a mobile app for remote monitoring.

This Arduino project serves as a foundation for environmental monitoring and can be expanded to meet specific requirements or integrated into larger systems for home automation or industrial applications.
