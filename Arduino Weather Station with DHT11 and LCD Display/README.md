# Arduino Weather Station with DHT11 and LCD Display

*Description:*

This Arduino project creates a weather station using a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor along with an LCD display. The DHT11 sensor measures environmental conditions, and the Arduino displays the data on the LCD screen. The system also includes a temperature alert feature that triggers when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.

*Hardware Setup:*

  **DHT11 Sensor:**
  
  1. Connect the positive (VCC) pin of the DHT11 sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
  2. Connect the negative (GND) pin of the DHT11 sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
  3. Connect the data pin of the DHT11 sensor to digital pin 9 on the Arduino.
